The difference between TestNG and Cucumber is the features file. You write your test scenario in your features file.
You need to add a tag to run a scenario. You need to decide which test should be with a tag name.
You also need runners class to run your tests instead of clicking run button. So you need the test's tagName to run that test.
Runner class is created only once.
